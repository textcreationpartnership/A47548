            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THe divine and laudable Science of Aſtrology, is a Learning that teaches by the Natures, Motions, Configurations, Significations, and Influences of the Heavens and Stars therein, how to judge of future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, or predict natural Events: the word Aſtrology, is derived from <hi>Aſtra</hi> and <hi>Logos,</hi> which is as much as to ſay the Speech, reaſoning or language of the Stars; and to this we find the Pſalmiſt conſent, when he ſings, <hi>the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his handy works: day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night ſheweth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: there is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard: their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the World: in them hath he ſet a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle

Thus being led by the ſignification of the word, or appellation of this Noble Art, unto thoſe places of Scripture firſt; I ſhall now look back to the beginning of the Holy Writ, and ſo take along in order ſeveral portions thereof, that farther prove the Stars to have influence on all ſub-lunary things, whether Animal, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or Mineral; to begin then, obſerve, <hi>And God ſaid, let there be Lights in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of the Heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for Signs and for Seaſons, and for days and years: And let them be for lights in the Firmament of the Heaven, to give light upon the Earth; and it was ſo: And God made two great Lights; the greater Light to rule the day, and the leſſer Light to rule the Night; he made the Stars alſo: And God ſet them in the Firmament of the Heaven, to give light upon the earth; and to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkneſs; and God ſaw that it was good, Geneſis</hi> the 1.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>And for the precious Fruits
<pb facs="tcp:32293:3"/>
brought forth by the Sun, and for the precious things put forth by the Moon, Deuteronomy</hi> the 33.14. Again, <hi>they ſought from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Stars in their Courſes fought againſt</hi> Siſera, <hi>Judges</hi> the 5.20. <hi>Canſt thou bind the ſweet Influences of the</hi> Pleiades, <hi>or looſe the bands of</hi> Orion, <hi>Job</hi> the 38.31. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will hear the Heavens, and they ſhall hear the Earth; and the Earth ſhall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, and they ſhall hear</hi> Jezreel, <hi>Hoſea</hi> the 2.21, 22. Many more places might be produced, but theſe are ſufficient to convince any ſober Perſon, that thoſe glorious Bodies, were not by their Maker placed in the Heavens only for ignorant people to gaze at; but to ſhew forth his Almighty Power, in their ſubordinate Rule and Government: And now ſeeing this their Lordſhips is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by ſenſible and palpable acts and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it muſt needs follow, that they have a ſecret and hidden way of Rule, whereby they operate imperceptibly in all their agitations of their Dominion: the Sun and Moon indeed have their palpable effects, for the Sun is the Fountain of heat, and that heat is the Nurſe of Life; alſo his preſence and abſence cauſeth day and night: likewiſe his nearneſs to, and remoteneſs from our <hi>Zenith,</hi> together with the nature
<pb facs="tcp:32293:4"/>
of the Parts of Heaven he paſſeth through, cauſeth Summer and Winter, heat and cold, alteration of days and nights: now the Moon ſeems to be as much the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of moiſture, as the Sun is of heat, as is apparent by the Tydes, which conſtantly attend her motion; and by all ſorts of Shell-Fiſh, and the eyes of Cats, which are all fuller and bigger at the Full-Moon, then they are at the Change or New-Moon: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is very obſervable, that if a man chance to fall aſleep, abroad in the Fields in a Moon-light night, how ſhe beſots him, and fills him with dulneſs and drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but beſides thoſe palpable acts of the Sun and Moon, they have their ſecret and imperceptible influence, as the other Planets and Stars; for though heat is the Nurſe of Life, and moiſture an hand-maid to it, yet it is not the mere heat which giveth life, nor the mere moiſture that helpeth to live; for if ſo, then might man make living Creatures artificially, but this we ſee is paſt his skill to do; the heat may hatch the eggs, but all the art of man cannot make an egg that can be hatched: No, for there is a ſecret act of Sun and Moon, beſides the mere putting to of heat and moiſture, which produceth life both in ſenſitive and vegetive Animals. And in
<pb facs="tcp:32293:4"/>
theſe ſecret and inſenſible operations or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, of the Sun, Moon, and Stars; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the light which they give, conſiſts that rule, which they do exerciſe over all the Sons of day and night: ſo that man if he lives upon the earth, muſt come under the touch thereof, ſo well as Brutes and Vegetives. And this Power, man being unable to avoid; but muſt in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſubmit thereunto, the Stars therefore are ſaid to give Laws unto him, and to the whole Body of Mortallity, ſo long as the World endureth: So then, <hi>Aſtra regunt homines, ſed regit Aſtra Deus,</hi> the Stars rule men, but God rules the Stars. Ay, but hark ye, (ſay ſome) what do you tell us of the heat and moiſture of the Sun and Moon, and their ſecret influences in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and upholding life; it is God that giveth life to all Creatures, and maintains the ſame in them, and he it is, that ruleth all perſons and things on earth: So ſay we too, this we know and believe, only the queſtion is, how he does them? whether with means or without? if without means, then every Child that is born, every living creature that is brought forth, and every Seed and Herb that grows out of the Ground, comes to paſs by a new creation, as well as by generation, for to bring
<pb facs="tcp:32293:5"/>
things to paſs without means, is all one as to produce them without matter, it being no more but to ſay, let there be men, let there be all other living creatures, and let there be Herbs, Seeds and Flowers; and, as the word ſays, they come to paſs: but we know there was never above one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the Scripture tells us, <hi>that on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day God ended his Work, which he had made, and he reſted on the ſeventh day from all his work, which he had made, Gen.</hi> 2.2. And ever ſince that, all things have come to paſs by nature, and therefore muſt there be ſome kind of natural means for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction thereof: and now if with means theſe things come to paſs, it is either by earthly means alone, or by the help of ſome Super-Terreſtrial Powers alſo aiding and aſſiſting, that they come to paſs: but by earthly means alone it is plain they cannot come to paſs, for it is not either Fire, Air, Earth, or Water, or all together, that can of themſelves produce or maintain life to any creature, or beſtow that goodly ſweet ſavour unto the Roſe: there muſt therefore be for certain ſome other Superiour Power aiding and aſſiſting, and this powerful ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the Scripture, reaſon, and experience tells us, is lodged in the Heavens and Stars; as communicated unto them, by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb facs="tcp:32293:5"/>
Creator. 'Tis true indeed, that God is as well able to govern and maintain all things without means, as he was at firſt to conſtitute and create the frame of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but ſuch is his pleaſure, that he does work by means; and not immediately in all things: &amp; therefore though it be the hand of God that doth all theſe things, yet is not that hand of God put to by any new contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved act, but follows on courſe in the motion of nature, even as from the beginning it was contrived from all Eternity: for the works of God are known unto him, from the beginning unto the end of the World; which knowledge of God, before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was no where written, but in his own Eternal Mind; but after, it was printed in a certain Book, called Nature, wherein, all the works of God, that were to come to paſs in time, were expreſly written down, as they were to follow in order, this Book of Nature, was a certain frame or model of the World, wherein, what by Creation, and generation, all perſons, things, and actions, were to take their ſeveral courſes and turns, ſo as to come to paſs in time, from the beginning unto the ending of the World. And ſo infinitely and wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, was this model of the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived; that though the riſe and fall of
<pb facs="tcp:32293:6"/>
Perſons, Towns, and Countreys, do depend upon the Virtues &amp; Vices of the men there inhabiting; and thoſe Virtues and Vices, do depend upon the free agency of thoſe mens wills: yet ſuch was the contrivance, that neither the fall of the firſt man, and the corruption, and the cruſh which the world endureth thereupon; nor the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſins of after mankind, and the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that do continually follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, did neceſſarily require, any correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or amendment, of that firſt frame: but ſuch was the infinitely to be admired and never enough to be adored forecaſt and providence of God; that at one view, appearhing unto him, all the ſeveral turnings and windings of all mens Wills, and the total ſum and upſhot of all Virtue and Vice; he did at once, ſo contrive, that all fates of proſperity and adverſity, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and puniſhment, ſhould ſo fall out and come to paſs, as to anſwer the Virtues and Prayers of the Righteous, and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Villanies of the wicked, each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works, in due and fit ſuiting times: this Field is ſo large, that if I ſhould walk much further therein, I ſhould too much exceed the bounds of an Epiſtle, to ſo ſmall a Treatiſe: I would therefore wiſh all young Students, and true

                        <p>In the third Column you have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations of the Planets, in it and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ♈, is ☉ 19. under him, over againſt ♉, you may ſee <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> 3. So the 19 Degree of ♈ is the very Point of the ☉ <hi>s</hi> Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the 3 Degree of ♉ is the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> 
                           <hi>s. &amp;c.</hi> yet you muſt underſtand that the Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Planet reaches the whole Sign.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth Column is Triplicities written over head, under which againſt ♈ ♌ ♐, is ☉ ♃; ☉ under <hi>d.</hi> and ♃ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                        <p>In the next five Columns is contained the terms of the Planets, the firſt 6 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ♈ is the terms of ♃, from 6 to 14 the terms of ♀, from 14 to 21 the terms of ☿, from 21 to 26 the terms of ♂, and from 26 to 30 are the terms of ♄. So of the reſt in order.</p>
                        <p>Every Sign is again divided into three equal Parts, called Faces or Decanates, ſo the firſt 10 Degrees of ♈ is the face of ♂, from 10 to 20 the face of ☉, and from 20 to 30 the face of ♀: obſerve the ſame in the reſt.</p>
                        <p>Next is the Detriments, as you will find ♀ in ♈ is in her Detriment, ♂ in ♉ in his Detriment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>The laſt Column tells you the falls of the Planets, ſo ♄ in ♈ is in his fall, ♂ in ♋ in his fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>A Planet in his Exaltation, denotes a Perſon of a high majeſtical carriage, a proud lofty diſpoſition, high minded; aſſuming more than his due, ſcorns to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>A Planet Peregrine, ſignifies a Perſon to be a Stranger, or Sojourner in the place where he is.</p>
                        <p>A Planet in his fall, denotes a Perſon averſe to honour, I believe it is becauſe he hath loſt it: for I have more than once experienced, that when a Planet was ſo poſited, the Perſon by him ſignified made Ship-wrack of his credit; but it prenotes only a preſent ſubjection to a misfortune, which in a little time may be vanquiſhed: In matters of War, a Planet in his fall is weaker than one in his detriment.</p>
                        <p>A Planet is in his detriment when he is in a Sign oppoſite to his own Houſe, in his fall when he is in the oppoſite Sign to his exaltation; and Peregrine when he is void

                     <p>OF theſe I ſhall take notice only of the moſt forceable, which are in number five, <hi>viz.</hi> the ☌ Conjunction, ⚹ Sextile, <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> Quartile, <g ref="char:trine">△</g> Trine, Oppoſition ☍.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:32293:13"/>A ☌ is when two Planets are in one and the ſame Degree and Minute of a Sign, this is the moſt powerful of all the Aſpects, and is good or bad according to the nature of the Planets conjoyned.</p>
                     <p>A ⚹ is when two Planets are diſtant one from each other the ſixth part of the Heavens, which is two Signs, or 60 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and is an Aſpect of imperfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>A <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> is when two Planets are diſtant from each other the fourth part of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack, which is three Signs or 90 Degrees, and this Aſpect is of imperfect Enmity.</p>
                     <p>A <g ref="char:trine">△</g> is when two Planets are the third part of the Heavens aſunder, which is four Signs or 120 Degrees, and this Aſpect is of perfect love and friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>And ☍ is when two Planets are diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to each other, <hi>viz.</hi> ſix Signs or 180 Degrees, this divideth the Heavens into two equal parts, and is an Aſpect of perfect evil; for being both in a direct line, and this diſtance aſunder they openly oppoſe each other.</p>
                     <p>The Aſpects go under two Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>viz.</hi> partil and platick. A partil Aſpect is when two Planets be exactly ſo many Degrees and Minutes from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as make a perfect Aſpect. A platick

admits of the moity of each Planets Orbs.</p>
                     <p>The Orbs of the Planets are thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> ♄ 9 Degrees, ♃ 9 Degrees, ♂ 8 Degrees, ☉ 17 Degrees, ♀ 7 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ☿ 7 Degrees, <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> 12 Degrees.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee the Orbs of ♄ is 9 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the half of which is 4 degr. 30 min. the Orbs of ☉ is 17 Degrees, the half thereof is 8 Degrees 30 Minutes, this being added together makes 13 Degrees, which tells you that when ♄ and ☉ are within 13 Degrees of a ☌; ⚹, <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, or ☍ to each other, they are ſaid to be in a platick Aſpect: now if they are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Aſpect, the good or evil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignified is not yet come to a perfect birth; but if they be ſeperating then it is over, I mean the heat thereof; but it will be viſable although in a declining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, till they are 13 Degrees ſeparated, and then it will wholly diſappear; you muſt likewiſe know, that Aſpects are dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſiniſter: therefore view the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owing Table.</p>

againſt it, to the left hand I find 0 hour, 0 minute, 0 ſecond, under time from noon: which tells me I have nothing of time, to add to the time of the Revolution; I therefore move along under time from noon, till I come to 9 hours, 27 minutes, which I cannot find, but I can have 9 hours, 25 minutes, 44 ſeconds, this wants but a little more than a minute thereof, which is near enough.

                        <p>However, you ought in a general way, to prefer and eſteem the Scheme of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs into ♈ above all the reſt: For the Ancients have affirmed that the Sun was placed in this very Sign, and in the firſt <hi>punctum</hi> thereof at the Creation; where he began his unwearied courſe, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi>

                        <p>Therefore muſt the Poſition of Heaven at the time of his return thereunto every year, be the Principal Piller on which we are to build our Aſtrological Judgment of Mundane Affairs: and this we need not cavil at, if we do but conſider that he is <hi>ſons vitae,</hi> the Fountain of Life; <hi>fons lucis,</hi> the Fountain of Light, or <hi>anima mundi,</hi> the Soul of the World, by which all things, as well Vegetatives as Senſitives have their ſubſiſtence and vivifying nouriſhment.</p>

                     <p>Thoſe that are red or fiery, be Comets of ♂, they denote Wars, Quarrels, Duels, Blood-ſhed, Tumults, Seditions, Maſſacres, Sea-fights, Thundering and Lightning in the Ayr, and in mens minds too: nothing delights them now but the clattering of Arms and ruſſing of Armies; Thieves and Robbers abound, ſcorching hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, drying up Rivers, Wells and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, intollerable Diſeaſes, <hi>Mars</hi> will be rampant in earneſt.</p>

                     <p>♈. A Comet or Blazing-ſtar appearing in this Sign, is the <hi>prodromus</hi> of Wars, claſhing of Armies, Blood-ſhed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to Grandees, death of ſome mighty Prince, Drought, cruel Diſeaſes among men, rot or murrain amongſt ſmall Cattle.</p>

                     <p>♊.

                     </p>
                     <p>♎. In this Sign it imports plenty of Thieves, Robbers, or Padders on the High-ways, poverty and want, the death of ſome great Perſon, Slaughters, Plots or occult Conſpiracies, high Winds, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, a drying up of Rivers and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſcarcity of the Fruits of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>♏. Here a Comet doth ſignifie Wars, Quarrels, Rebellions, Perils and Dangers ſurround the People, ſcarcity of Corn and Fruits, little water, and that is corrupted or unwholeſome, cauſing Sickneſs to thoſe that uſe it, Teeming-women are very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of many Troubles.</p>

                     <p>♑. Here it denotes Wars, Quarrels, Calamities, poyſoning of Princes, cutting by the High-ways, contempt of Religion, Perſecution to many Profeſſors thereof, peſtilent Diſeaſes, ſharp Froſts and cold Weather, great Snows, Famine or ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Proviſions, much Miſchief on foot among People:</p>
                     <p>♒. In this Sign it menaces terrible and durable Wars, a ſweeping Peſtilence, dark obſcure Ayr, high Winds, Thunder and Lightning, ſome great Prince or Lady yields to the Grave.</p>
                     <p>♓. Laſtly, a Comet or Blazing-Star in this Sign preſages Wars, Slaughters, high Differences among Relations and Friends, Contentions about Religion, prodigious Apparitions, tumultuous Bickerings, over-ſwelling of Rivers, dammage to Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Thus have you a brief and true account of the natural ſignifications of thoſe Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, which by the will of the Almighty are hanged over peoples heads, to allarum them againſt approaching evils.</p>

                        <head>Some neceſſary Rules to be well obſerved in Predictions relating to the Subject of this Book, or indeed to any part of Aſtrology.</head>
                        <p>Firſt, know that generally, ♄ and ♂ are evil Planets, or Infortunes: ♃ and ♀ are good Planets, or Fortunes: ☿ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> indifferent: the ☉ is <hi>Rex Planetarum vel Stellarum,</hi> the King or Prince of Planets or Stars: ♌ is his Manſion Houſe, ♈ his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32293:74"/>
Throne wherein he is exalted: or as Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> terms it, his Seat in Parliament: hence it will reſult, that he rules the Heart, and hath alſo much to do with the Brain of Kingdoms and Nations, ſo well as Perſons: Therefore I ſay, his ☌ <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> or ☍ is the very worſt of all Afflictions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in matter of Life or Honour: and his ⚹ or <g ref="char:trine">△</g> in ſuch reſpects more to be priz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the ſame Rays or ☌ of either ♃ or ♀.</p>
                        <p>Humane Signs, ſignifie men: beſtial Signs, Beaſts: aiery Signs, Birds of the Ayr: watery Signs, water-Fowl and Fiſh: earthy Signs, the Fruits of the Earth: the fiery Triplicity rule over the Eaſt part of the World, the aiery Weſt, the watery North, and the earthy South.</p>
                        <p>Remember the particular Beaſts under the five beſtial Signs, as under the rule of ♈ are Sheep, Coneys, or Rabbets: ♉ Bulls, Oxen, Cows: ♌ Deer, Lyons and other furious Beaſts: ♐ Horſes, Mules: ♑ Goats, Hogs, Hares.</p>
                        <p>♄ ♃ ♂ ☉ ☿ are maſculine Planets, ♀ <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> Feminine.</p>
                        <p>♄ ♃ ☉ are Diurnal Planets, ♂ ♀ <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> Nocturnal: ☿ Convertable: ☊ is Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, ☋ Feminine.</p>
                        <p>♂ ſignifies bold audacious Pyrates at

                        <p>This is meant when either of thoſe two Planets be Lord of an Eclipſe, Ruler of a Comet, or poſited in the ninth or third Houſe of a Revolution, and chiefly if then in evil Aſpect to the Lord of the Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope or <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. Make ♄ and ☉ Significators of Kings and Princes, with the Planet or Planets in the tenth; but their helpers take from the eleventh, and the Aſſiſters of the Vulgar People from the ſecond Houſe.</p>
